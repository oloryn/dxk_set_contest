# Set_contest

This script reads an ADIF file (passwd as the second command line argument) and creates a DXKeeper script which sets each QSO in the ADIF file to specific contest id (passed as the first command line argument).

The script is written to the 'setcontestname.txt' file in the DXKeeper Scripts directory.
